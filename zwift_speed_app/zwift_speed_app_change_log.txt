# Change Log

2022-12-06: 
- Creation of change log
- Update to fix on level for wheels:
  - Wheels with unlock level<6 were not showing when filtering data to such
  - Problem was use of level (where level=max(level_f, level_w)) rather than level_w
  - incorporated fix into frames data too, despite zwift 32mm wheel being 0 level, for future proofing
- Clean up of script
- Added infinity symbol to inputs and altered filtering to allow na values in level (i.e. when level = infinite)
- Tidy style.css and add orange color to the slider
- Added format_time_gap() function to redcue repetitive code
